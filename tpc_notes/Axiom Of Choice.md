States if you have an collection of non empty sets X then it is possible to choose one element from each set using a choice function.

Also if X is finite then it's called finite choice which is provable from other [[Axioms]], however Choice itsef is independent.

#### Choice Function 
If X is a collection of sets then a choice function on X maps X to it's own union so that $\mu(A) \in A$ for all A inside X, this $\mu$ basically takes a set and chooses one thing from inside it.

# Applications 
They tend to be [[Non-Constructive Proofs]] proofs.

#### In Terms Of Cartesian Products

If $\{ A_{j} \}$ is a family of sets with all of them non empty then 
$$
\prod_{j \in J} A_{j} \neq \phi
$$
Proof literally follows from definition of [[Cartesian Product]]
