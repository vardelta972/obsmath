$$
erf(x) = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2}dt
$$

It's asymptomatic limit equal 1 which implies the famous result 

$$
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} e^{-t^2}dt = \sqrt \pi
$$
Several proofs of this are: 

There is no closed form for this integral it is one of many [[Non Elementary Integrals]]. It's Antiderivative is here(by [[Integration By Parts]]):
