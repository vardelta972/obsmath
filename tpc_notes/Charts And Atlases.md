Charts give a local coordinate system to a [[Manifold]] while an atlas combines charts to form a global coordinate system.

### Charts
It's an open subset of M equipped with a homeomorphism function. Two charts may have some intersection in that case points there may be given two different coordinates by the two homeomorphisms, we can convert one coordinate to the other using [[transition maps]].

##### Examples: 

### Atlases
It's a collection of charts which covers M.
