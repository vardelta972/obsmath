A subset S of a [[Group]] G is called a Subgroup iff S is also a [[group]] with respect to the operations on G.

Note that empty set cannot be a [[group]] because of the identity requirement.

### The Theorem
S is a subgroup iff S is closed under * and non empty.
#pro <- closure is given. associtivity,inverses hold by simply restricting the quantifiers. Pick any v in S then it has an inverse in S then closure implies e is also in S. Done.
