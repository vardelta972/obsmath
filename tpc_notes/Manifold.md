Its a hausdorff,second countable space which is [[locally euclidean]].

### Examples: Rn is a manifold as for each x \in Rn we can consider the neighbourhood to be whole of Rn and take the identity function. The Surface $x^2 +y^2$ is also a manifold as for each x we consider neighbourhood to be Rn and take the func $(x,y,x^2+y^2) \to (x,y).$ Its of dimension 2.
