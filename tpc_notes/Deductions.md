A deduction of a sentence $\phi$ from a set of sentences A is a sequence of formulas such that the last formula is $\phi$ and if $\phi_{j}$ is chosen from this sequence then either it's from S or it's a Logical Axiom or Follows from the previous terms using Rules Of Inference. We write $A \vdash \phi$ to indicate that there exists a deduction of $\phi$ from A. When $\phi$ is not a sentence we just take its Universal Closure.

Observe one thing that if $\vdash \phi$ means that empty collection of statements proves $\phi$ which means that $\phi$ is provable from logical axioms and Inferences alone. Thus in a sense there types of statements are universal truths.

Due to the finite nature of deductions we get the following results 

- If $S \vdash \phi$ then some finite subset U of S also proves $\phi$. #pro Let P be the deduction of $\phi$
 from S then we pick all propositions from S in P and arrange them in a set J. This set is finite and $J \vdash \phi$ as P still qualifies as a deduction from J.

- If S is Inconsistent then some finite subset U of it must also be inconsistent. #pro Follows easily from the previous property.
