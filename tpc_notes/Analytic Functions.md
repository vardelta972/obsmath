## Real Analytic
f is real analytic on an open set U iff at each point we can expand it as a [[taylor series]] locally.

## Non-Examples:

## Complex Analytic
Its literally just a [[complex differentiable]] function on it's open domain. if U=C then f is entire.

#### Non-Examples
f(z)=$|z|^2$ which is not equal to z2 btw, as its diff at 0 but everywhere else non diff.

Thus only diff when z0=0.
