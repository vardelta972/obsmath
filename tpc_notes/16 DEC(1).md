### P1: PT Rn is [[Hausdorff Space]]
-> Given two distinct points x,y. Consider balls around both of them with radius less than half the distance between them. If they have a common point u then we must have $$
d(x,y)=d(x,u)+d(u,y).$$ But we have $$d(x,u)+d(u,y)<d(x,y).$$.

### P2: Power set topologies give rise to hausdorff spaces

-> If X contains less than 2 objects then its vacously true. Say X has atleast 2 ele then for any x,y \in X x,y qualify as neighbourhoods of their respective sets. Since they are assumed to be distinct we are done.

### P3: Rn is second countable.

-> Consider $B :=$ All balls centered at rational coordinates with rational radii. Then for every U in Rn for each rational $x \in U$ there is a ball $B_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq U.$ Now for each such $\epsilon$ we find any $0<r<\epsilon.$ then $$U = \bigcup_{x \in U} B_{r}(x).$$ Note that epsilon,r depend on x, but we choose to not indicate here.

### #imp P4: If $c \in X$ and $f_n : X \to X$ are functions for $n \geq 2$ then there exists a unique sequence in X $a_n$ such that $$a_1 =c, \forall n \geq 1 : a_{n+1}=f_{n+1}(a_n).$$ -> SKIPPED
