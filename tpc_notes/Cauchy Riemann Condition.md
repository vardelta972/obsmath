Used for determining [[complex differentiable]] functions.

The condition is
$$
\begin{matrix}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\end{matrix}
$$
where u,v are real and imaginary components of f respectively.

If f is differentiable then these [[partial derivatives]] exist and satisfy this #mpro #ipro #pro If f(z=x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y) is differentiable then


However the converse does not hold #pro #ipro 

### Equivalence To Complex [[Differentiability]]

Cauchy Riemann Conditions are equivalent to conplex [[differentiability]], given that f is continuously differentiable see [[Partial Derivatives]].
