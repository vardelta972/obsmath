D is dense in a topological space X iff forall x \in X all neighbourhoods around x have a non-empty intersection with D.

## In Metric Spaces
This becomes equivalent to forall x \in X there exists a seq in D conv to x.

### Examples: Q is dense in R, Qn dense in Rn, In the power set topology on X the set of all the singletons is not dense as $\emptyset$ is included.
