## Binomial Theorem 

$$
(x+y)^n = \sum C(n,r) x^r y^{n-r}.
$$
#pro -> Observe that a general term is of the form $x^ay^b$ where a+b=n, as when we expand we multiply stuff n times where x appears a times and y b times. Now we just need to find its coefficients ie no of distinct ways to construct that term. We order those brackets first then choose a of them to extract x from and b of them to extract y from this gives $\frac{n!}{a!b!}$.
