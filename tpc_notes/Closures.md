we say $x \in \bar{A}$ iff every neighbourhood arounf x has a nonempty intersection with A.

1) is trivial.
2) From 1 we have $\bar{A} \subseteq  \bar{\bar{A}}$. From the remaining use contradiction.
3) if $t \in \bar{(A \cup B)}$ then all neighbourhoods around t have a non empty intersection with AUB. Then it means either it shares something in A or B from here trivial. The other direction is trivial.
4) If some pont in A is not in closure then we have for some neighbourhood $U(x) \cap A = \phi$ but this means x is not in A.
5) Obviously
