$x_{0}$ is a limit point of a subset A of metric space iff $\exists (x_{n}) \subset A \to x_{0}: x_{n} \neq x_{0}$.

## Isolated Points
Those points which are not limit points, an interesting result about them are #pro functions are automatically continuous at isolated points c 
-> Since c is isolated there is only one seq xn=c which converges there implying f(xn)=f(c).
