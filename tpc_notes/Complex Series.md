A complex series converges iff it's sequence of partial sum converges.

### Relation between real and complex

$$
\sum z_{n}  =L \ \iff \ \sum \Re(z_{n}) = \Re(L) , \sum \Im(z_{n}) = \Im(L)
$$
#ipro #pro 

### Absolute Convergence 
We again have the result absolute convergence implies conditional convergence #mpro #ipro #pro 
For conditional convergence we need the convergence of
$$
\sum \Re(z_{n}) \ , \sum \Im(z_{n})
$$
Observe 
$$
\sum | \Re(z_{n})| \leq \sum |z_{n}|
$$
Similarly for the imaginary one. Thus by absolute convergence we get the convergence of the two series.

##### Example
$$
\sum \frac{z^n}{n!}
$$
converges absolutely thus the original series also converges.

Use absolute convergence then use [[Ratio Test Root Test]]
