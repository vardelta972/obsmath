An expression of form
$$
\sum a_{n} (x-x_{0})^n
$$
We say it's center is at $x_{0}$.

# Convergence 

### Radius Of Convergence 

They definitely converge inside the radius 
$$
\frac{1}{\lim_{ n \to \infty } (|a_{n}|)^{1/n} }
$$
or 
$$
\frac{1}{\lim_{ n \to \infty }| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}| }
$$

And they definitely diverge outside these.
