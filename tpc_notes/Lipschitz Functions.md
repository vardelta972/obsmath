A generalisation of this is [[Holder Continuous Functions ]] This is just the case for $\alpha=1.$

f between metric spaces is lipschitz iff
$$
\exists C \geq 0 \forall x,y : d(f(x),f(y)) \leq C d(x,y).
$$

There are so obviously continuous. In fact They are [[uniformly continuous]] #pro 

We let C >0 be a lipschitz constant of f. Then forall $\varepsilon>0$ we choose $\delta=\frac{\varepsilon}{C}$ then we have
$$
|x-y| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(y)| < C|x-y| \leq \varepsilon.
$$

Not necessarily differentiable as $|x|$ is a counterexample using reverse trangle inequality.

## Non-Examples
The [[Drichlet Function]] is not lipschitz as it's not continuous or more explicitly:
