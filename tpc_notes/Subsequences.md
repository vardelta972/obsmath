Just choose terms from seq such that indices are strictly increasing.

### Rigorous Definition 

# Convergence

Turns out $a_{n} \to L \iff$ all its subsequences converge to L also.
#pro -> Say $a_{n_{k}}$ is a subsequence of an then we choose given any neighbourhood N(L) an N>0 st $\forall n \geq N : a_{n} \in N(L)$. Then $\forall k \geq N$ we have $n_{k} \geq k$ which implies $a_{n_{k}} \in N(L).$ Converse follows easily by shift theorem.
