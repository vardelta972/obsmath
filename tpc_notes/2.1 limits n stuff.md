1) take any neighbourhood $U(y+z)$ let A,B denote the neighbourhoods around y,z obtained by subtracting z,y from the elements respectively. Then there exists neighbourhoods $V(x),B(x)$ such that
$$
f(V(x)) \subseteq A, g(B(x)) \subseteq B
$$
Observe $(f+g)(V(x)+B(x)) \subseteq A+B = U(y+z)$ 
#verify 

2) Let U(cy) be a neighbourhood then $U(cy)=cU(y)$ now there exists a neighbourhood $A(x)$ such that
$$
f(A(x)) \subseteq U(y) \implies cf(A(x)) \subseteq cU(y) =U(cy)
$$
