A group is a set G equipped with an operation + such that

G is closed under +
the operation + is associative over G
All elements of G have inverses under +
There exists an identity element wrt +

A Group is Abelian when commutativity holds
### Basic Properties 
- identity element e is unique as any binary operation * can have atmost 1 identity #pro say e,e' are two identities then 
$$
e*e' =e,e'*e=e'
$$

which implies the result.

- Inverses are also unique as under any binary operation * each element can have atmost 1 inverse #pro say a,b are two inverses of c then
    
$$
ac=e=bc
$$

now multiply both sides to the right by any one of the inverses then get $a=b.$
