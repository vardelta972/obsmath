States if $[a_n,b_n]$ are nested so that $a_n$ increases and $b_n$ decreases then their intersection is always nonempty.[[16 DEC TST#P8 States if $[a_n,b_n]$ are nested so that $a_n$ increases and $b_n$ decreases then their intersection is always nonempty.]]

It's or atleast it's logic is pretty important


#### Proof Using [[IVT]]
## Special Case

if the length of subintervals goes to 0 then intersection has exactly one element [[16 DEC TST#P9 if the length of subintervals goes to 0 then intersection has exactly one element.]]. An Application of this is in [[Cantor Set]].

## Generalisation 
This generalises to the Nested Compact Sets Theore:
If $K_{n}$ are nonempty nested compact sets then their intersection is nonempty. Moreover If $diam(K_{n}) \to 0$ then it's intersection is a singleton. #mpro #ipro #pro 
From each $K_{n}$ kidnap 😈 a term $a_{n}$ then $a_{n} \in K_{1}$ giving us a convergent subsequence $a_{k_{n}} \in K_{1}$ with limit L in K1. Now observe for $n\geq 2, a_{n} \in K_{2}$ implying L is in K2 also, similarly in general we get L is in each Kn. Thus intersection non-empty.

For special case:
Say the intersection also contains L' the we have the inequality 
$$
|L-L'| \leq diam(K_{n}), \forall n
$$
the result literally drops out by squeezing hard. 😏
