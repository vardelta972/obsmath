### Addition Principle

If P is a partition of a finite set X then: $$|X| = \sum_{J \in P} |J|$$ Note that P is finite since X can only have finitely many subsets.

### Multiplication Principle

Just a special case of addition principle when Partition P has members of equal size k:
$$|X|=k|P|.$$

### Division Principle

If $Q/=$ is a quotient set of a finite set Q and each of its [[Equivalence Class]] have size k then since its a partition of Q we have $$|Q| = k|Q/=|.$$
