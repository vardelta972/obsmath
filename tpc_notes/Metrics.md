## Product Metric
We define Metric on $\prod X_{j}$ (this is a finite product ) by
$$
D(A,B)=\max d_{j}(A^j,B^j)
$$
ie simply calculate distance between individual components then take their maximum.
### Continuity of Metrics
Metric as a real valued function is continuous itself. #pro #mpro #ipro 
This can be done by repeated applications of triangle inequality.
