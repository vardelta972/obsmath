f has IVP iff for any given y between two values of f, y is attained at some point.

### $f(x,y)=x^2 + y^2$ on $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ has IVP whereas on removing the point (0,0) it no longer has IVP a more obscure example is given by removing all irrational points as these domains so obtained are no longer compact. See [[IVT]].
