We often define seq by defining the first term and using constructor functions fn to construct the next terms, it has a rigorous justification.

## Rigour

If $c \in X$ and $f_n : X \to X$ are functions for $n \geq 2$ then there exists a unique sequence in X $a_n$ such that $$a_1 =c, \forall n \geq 1 : a_{n+1}=f_{n+1}(a_n).$$ Proof [[]] (by [[Halmos_NaiveSetTheory.pdf]])
