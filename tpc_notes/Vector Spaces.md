## All Vector spaces are isomorphic to Rn
For finite dimensions only. Say V is m dimensional with basis f1,...,fm
construct an isomorphism $f: V \to R^m$ as follows 
$$
f(f_{j}) = e_{j}
$$
Then its clearly injective as all linear transforms are automatically injective and given a v in Rn expand v then write each ej in terms of fj then combine using linearity, this gives surjectivity.
