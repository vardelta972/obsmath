States if $f,g:U \subset R^n \to R$ where U is open consider the constraint set $S=\{ x \in U : g(x)=c \}$ where c is fixed already. Then if $x \in S$ is a local maximum of f then either

$$
\nabla g(x) = 0 \lor \nabla f(x) = \lambda \nabla g(x), \exists \lambda scalar.
$$
its useful when combined with the Maximum Principle [[Maxima And Minima]] and the fact that S is closed.
