Its a continuous function that is differentiable nowhere

$$
	f(x)=\sum a^n\cos(b^n \pi x)
$$
where, $a \in (0,1)$ and $ab > 1 + \frac{3\pi}{2}$ is continuous on whole of R but differentiable nowhere.
This [[series of functions]] converges uniformly by weierstrass-M test [[Series Of Functions#Weierstrass M-Test]] and is continuous because of it.
