we say $a \equiv b (m od \ n) \iff n |b-a$

## Some Properties
Its an equivalence relation which obeys substitution for polynomial functions. Also behaves well with addition and multiplication. 

But for division we have
$$
a \equiv b (m od  \ n) \iff \frac{a}{m} \equiv \frac{b}{m} \left( m od \ \frac{n}{gcd(n,m)} \right)
$$

given m divides both a,b.

# Relation To Remainders

a,b are cong mod n is equiv to saying they leave the same remainder upon division by n.
