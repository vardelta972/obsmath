Differentiability does imply continuity as usual.
In actuality the above limit is
$$
\lim_{ (u,v) \to 0} \frac{f(x+u,y+v)-f(x,y)}{(u,v)}
$$
Where we have the complex division. Note that as per [[Construction Of C]] (a,b) and a+ib are the same.
### Properties

To prove the division one just prove the spacial case $\frac{1}{g}$ using [[limits]]. To prove the [[chain rule]] go to it's dedicated section.

#### Examples
Conjugation is not complex differentiable as approaching from real and imaginary axes
$$
x_{n} = z_{0}+\frac{1}{n}, \ y_{n}=z_{0}+\frac{i}{n}
$$
but then the limit of the sequences of difference quotients evaluate to $1,-1$ respectively.

This directly implies non differentiablility of Im and Re functions.
