$f:[a,b] \to R$ which is bounded is called riemann integrable iff $\forall \epsilon >0 \exists$Partition into subintervals $P$ such that $$U(f,P)-L(f,P)< \epsilon.$$
## Sequential Criteria

f is integrable iff there exists a seq of partitions Pn st $||P_n|| \to 0$ and $U(f,P_n)-L(f,P_n) \to 0.$ [[16 DEC TST#P7 f is integrable iff there exists a seq of partitions Pn st $ P_n to 0$ and $U(f,P_n)-L(f,P_n) to 0.$]]

# Integrability Of Continuous Functions
Since we talk about closed intervals we can use that fact that f becomes uniformly continuous automatically there:

# Upper And Lower Integrals

We define
$$
\int ^U \, f = \inf \{ U(f,P):P \ partition \}
$$
and
$$
\int _{L}f \, =\sup \{ L(f,P):P \ partition \}
$$

f is integrable iff these are equal. This is equivalent to the first definition.
