# Quotient Graph
If G is a graph with an equivalence relation @ then we define a new graph G/@ with vertices from V/@ and we define to have two vertices $[v],[w]$ are adjacent iff atleast one members of $[v],[w]$ are adjacent, so we check each pair $\{ [v],[w] \}$ of eq classes for adjacency then create an edge e st $\gamma(e)=\{ [v],[w] \}$.
