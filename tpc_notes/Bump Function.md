Define
$$
\psi(x) = e^{-1/x}, x >0 \ and \ 0 \ otherwise
$$
This is a smooth function the proof is given as 

Now we define the bump function
$B(x)=e^2 \psi(1+x)\psi(1-x)$ then this is zero outside the interval $[-1,1]$ and 1 everywhere else moreover it's smooth with B(0) = 1, and increasing to the left of 0 and decreasing to it's right.

This can be used to construct [[Smooth Transition Function]].
