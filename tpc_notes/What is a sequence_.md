A sequence is just a procession of objects one after another written in the form $$x_1,....,x_n,....$$ it may or may not be infinite and the starting index can vary.

## Rigorous Description

In the above intuitive definition observe a sequence is characterised by its indices and corresponding terms at those indices. This notion can be captured by any function with domain as some initial segment of natural numbers. 

One special fact the function $$f: \emptyset \to X$$ qualifies as a sequence and is called empty sequence. For all X there's exactly one such function btw.
