$$
\prod (1+a_{n}) \ converges \ \iff \sum a_{n} \ converges
$$
Works for non negative sequences.Use
$$
\prod (1+a_{n}) = e^{\sum \ln (1+a_{n})} 
$$
and $\ln(1+x) \leq x, \forall x \geq 0$ which can be proved using [[MVT]] or [[Maxima And Minima#Second Derivative Test]]. This also gives a very easy proof the divergence of the harmonic series.
