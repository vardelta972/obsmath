used to convert between two coordinate patches. If U,V are charts with an intersection then 

$$f_V\cdot f^{-1}_U : f_{U}(U \cap V) \to f_V(U \cap V)$$ is the transition function from coordinate system of U to the system of V.

$$f_U \cdot f^{-1}_V : f_V(U \cap V) \to f_U(U \cap V)$$
This one for V to U.
These transition maps are also homeomorphisms.(why?)
