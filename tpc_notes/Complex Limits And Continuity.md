## Sequences
They are well behaved with algebraic operations as we can always break them into real and imaginary components and anaylse them instead. But we prove one for example anyways:

The proof of $|z_{n}| \to |W|$ is done by reverse triangle inequality.

near z0 means in a deleted neighbourhood. These things again can be equivalently broken down into real and imaginary parts and analysed seperately.

## Continuity

Again Re and Im criterion always holds simply by [[Construction Of C]].

### Examples
Re(z) and Im(z) are both continuous as conjugation is continuous ($\delta=\varepsilon$). but not [[complex differentiable]]
