A topological space is hausdorff iff every two distinct points have atleast one pair of disjoint neighbourhoods.

### Examples: Rn with standard topoz. is hausdorff([[16 DEC TST#P1 PT Rn is Hausdorff]]). C is also a hausdorff space, Power set topologies give rise to hausdorff spaces([[16 DEC TST#P2 Power set topologies give rise to hausdorff spaces]])

#### Uniqueness Of [[Limits]]
Sequences have unique [[limits]] here. #provsay L,L' are two distinct [[limits]] of an then we have neighbourhood $U(L) \cap V(L') = \phi$ but an is eventually in both of them contradicting this fact.

As a consequence [[limits]] of functions in these spaces are also unique
