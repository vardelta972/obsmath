### Interpretations Of ZFC
Since ZFC which is a [[First Order Theory]] consists essentially of just a single binary predicate $\in$ we just need to specify it's interpretation and domain of the quantifiers(Domain Of Discourse).

For example If we choose $D=Z$ and $\in$ to be $<$. Then the result is an interpretation but not a valid one in which axioms hold.
