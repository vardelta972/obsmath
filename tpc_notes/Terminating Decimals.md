A rational number r has a terminating decimal expansion iff the denominator only has powers of 2 and 5. #mpro #ipro #pro 

<- Since $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ both have terminating expansions so does this particular algebraic combination $\frac{a}{2^n 5^m}$ this is due to preservation of terminating decimals under algebraic operations.(except for roots)

-> Since p/q is rational for large enough n $\frac{p}{q} 10^n$ is an integer but since $gcd(p,q)=1$ and $q$ must divide $p 10^n$ we get that q divides 10n which implies q must contain powers 2 and five only as if it contains a prime p not 2 or 5 then as $gcd(p,10^n)=1$ we get p=1 a contradiction. 

### In Other Bases

As an example in binary r terminates iff its denominator has powers of 2.
