### example 
PT there is no universal set.
Say that there is call it $\Omega$ then consider 
$$
S = \{ x \in \Omega : x \not\in x  \}
$$
then if S contains itself then it doesn't. If it doesn't then it thus. This gives the truth of
$$
S \in S \iff S \not\in S
$$
But this cant be true as $P,\neg P$ always have opposite values. Thus this can't exist.

#### 3.2.2
Consider $\{ A,B \}$ then either A is disjoint or B is disjoint from it.If A disjoint then $\{ A,B \}$ and A can't have common members in particular $B \notin A$ similarly in the other case we get $A \not\in B$ .

#### 3.2.3
The universal set can be constructed ad follows 
$$
\Omega = \{ x : x=x \}
$$
For the other direction: The set 
$$
\{ x \in \Omega : \phi(x) \}
$$
works.

#### 3.2.1
We use the principle of explosion, consider the statement 
$$
P \lor (S \in S \iff S \not\in S)
$$
since the latter statement is false as well we must have P is true.
