States if f(a)=f(b) then 
$$
f'(c)=0 ,\exists c \in (a,b).
$$
Where f is cont on a compact interval and differentiable on its interior. Its proof is using the maximum principle [[Maxima And Minima]]. #pro ->Either both of extrema on the boundary or atleast on on the interior. If on the boundary then as $f([a,b])=[min,max]$ we get that f is 0. Otherwise the first derivative test gives the answer.
