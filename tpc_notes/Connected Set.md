Topologically[[Topological Spaces]], S is connected iff it is not disconnected LOLðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£

It's different drom path connected sets
#### Disconnected Sets
S is disconnected iff it can be partitioned into two non empty open sets.

#### Local Connectedness
S is locally connected iff for each point x theres a neighbourhood around x which is a connected set.

## Important Result In Metric Spaces
Continuous functions map connected sets to connected sets #pro -> Say f(E) is disconnected then partition it into two non empty open sets U,V. Continuity implies their respecti inverse images are open but observe their intersection must be empty implies E is disconnected a contradiction.
