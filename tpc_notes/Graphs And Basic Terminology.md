A graph consists of vertices,edges and an instruction function which tells each edge which two edges to connect or to connect to itself in which case that edge is called a loop.

### Paths
A path is a sequence of adjacent vertices not necessarily distinct and the edges corresponding to each pair of adjacent vertices are distinct.

###### Connected Graphs
Each two distinct vertices connected by a path.
In disconnected graphs we may be able to divide it into connected graphs (components).

##### Simple Paths
All vertices required to be distinct 

#### Circuits
A path which ends at the same vertex it begins at.

##### Simple Circuits
All vertices except the last one distinct.

## Degree
$deg(v)=$Number of edges connected to v.

# Most Important Theorem

$$
2|E|=\sum v_{j}
$$
-> We use induction on the number of vertices n. Base step is trivial. In the induction step n+1 let Eold = all old edges from n vertices, Enew = all new edges generated by inserting n+1st vertex. Then 
$$
2|E|=2|E_{old} \cup E_{new}|=\sum deg_{old} (v) + 2deg(v_{n+1})
$$
Now $\sum deg(v)$ is obtained by adding 1 to the number of vertices connected to vn+1 of which there are deg(vn+1) many thus this reduces to

$$
2|E| = \sum deg(v).
$$
as adding one to those deg(vn+1) updates the info which needs to be updated. Rest remains the same.

#### Regular Graphs
degree of all vertices same eg Kn is regular,Dn is also but not Ln cuz of 1st vertex.
