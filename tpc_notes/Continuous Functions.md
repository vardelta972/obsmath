## Topological Notion

$f:X \to Y$ is continuous iff preimage of open sets are open. This is equivalent to #pro #ipro #mpro preimages of [[closed sets]] are closed. -> Say $C \subseteq Y$ is closed then its complement is open implying $f^{-1}(C^c)$ is also open implying 
$$
f^{-1} (C) = f^{-1}(C^c)^c 
$$
is closed.

### In Metric Spaces
f is cont at x0 iff #pro $$\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta  > 0 \forall x \in X : d(x,x_{0})<\delta \to  d(f(x),f(x_{0}))<\varepsilon.$$


Which is equivalent to the topological description of continuity at x0-> Trivial
<- Let U(f(x0)) be a neighbourhood then 

#### Examples
Norm is a continuous function by reverse triangle inequality
