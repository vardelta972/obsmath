## Topological Notion
a seq an in a topological space X conv to L iff
$$
\forall N(L) \exists N\geq 0 \forall n\geq N:a_{n} \in N(L)
$$
ie given any neighbourhood around L an is eventually in that neighbourhood. These [[limits]] are unique in Hausdorff Spaces

## Epsilon N Criterion
Equivalent to topological criterion whenever theres a metric space structure
$$
a_{n} \to L \iff \forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists N>0 \forall n \geq N : d(a_{n},L)<\varepsilon.
$$
# Relation With Sebsequences
See [[Subsequences]].

##### In discrete Spaces
Only eventually constant sequences converge. #pro If an in discrete space converges to c then it is eventually in the neighbourhood $\{ c \}$. Converse is trivial.

Convergence is also componentwise.
