### Propositions and predicates
A proposition is something which can take only one of two values $\lbrace T,F \rbrace$. A predicate is something which eats several things and produces a proposition.

### Construction Of Compound Propositions And Predicates

$\neg \land \lor \implies \iff$ are used for this purpose.

### Axiom Systems

An axiom system consists of a set of objects which can be used to construct more objects using operators, a set of operators which do stuff to objects, we can put operators into each other to get more operators, a set of predicates which will allow us to ask questions about objects, using connectives we can combine them to produce more predicates, a collection of propositions called Axioms which will be used to derive axioms.

Note that all statements/operations must be construed from existing ones.

### Examples: Take C = {0},P={is a natural number,=}, F={++}, A ={[[Peano Axioms]]} then we get the system of arithmetic, an axiom system describing N.

### Models Of Axiom Systems
A model is obtained by giving a meaning/interpretation to first three component of an axiom system so that the axioms hold. There may be multiple models of an axiom system. (is there any with just one or no models?)

Two models are equivalent iff they can prove each others theorems.
#### Examples: The Rock Model Of N-> 0 becomes no rocks,++ becomes incrementation by 1, is a natural number becomes is a possibly empty collection of rocks.

#### Example of equivalence: Rock model is equivalent to stick model.
