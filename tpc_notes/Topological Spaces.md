Its a set X equipped with a subset of P(X) $\tau$ so that 
$$
\begin{align}
\phi,X \in \tau \\
\bigcup A_{\alpha} \in \tau \\
\bigcap B_{n} \in \tau
\end{align}
$$
where $A_{\alpha}$ is any family of sets and $B_{n}$ is a finite family in $\tau.$

### Examples: Rn with $\tau=$All open sets is a topological space.
[[cofinite topology]] [[cocountable topology]] [[particular point topology]]

#### Discrete Space
When $\tau=P(X)$ In these only eventually constant sequences converge.

#### Chaotic Space
When $\tau = \{ \phi,X \}$, In these all sequence converge and uniqueness of [[limits]] fails!

## Comparison 
We say $\tau_{1}$ is finer than $\tau_{2}$ iff $\tau_{1}$ has more stuff ie
$$
\tau_{2} \subseteq \tau_{1}
$$
