We say two rational cauchy sequences are equivalent iff 
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } d(a_{n},b_{n}) =0.
$$
Where the limit is taken in Q. Then we can define
$$
R = Cauchy/â‰ˆ
$$

This means that a real number is just a collection of all rational numbers that tend to the same limit. So the real number 1 is just all seq in Q converging to 1, $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is just all seq in Q conv to $\sqrt{ 2 }$.
