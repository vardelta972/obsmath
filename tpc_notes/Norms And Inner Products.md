# Sequences
For a sequence/vector x its lp norm is defined as
$$
|x|_{p} = \left( \sum x_{j}^p \right)^{1/p}
$$
and inner product defined as $x \cdot y = \sum x_{j}y_{j}$

# Functions 
$$
\lvert f \rvert _{p} = \left( \int f^p \, dx  \right)^{1/p}
$$
and inner product defined as $f \cdot g = \int fg \, dx$
