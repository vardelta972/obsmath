# In Inner product Spaces
$$
|<u,v>| \leq |u\mid |v|.
$$
#pro #mpro #ipro -> Define a function $f : R \to R$ as follows 
$$
f(t)=\lvert tu - v \rvert ^2
$$
Then we have $f(t)=|tu-v|^2= <tu-v,tu-v> = t^2 |u|^2 - 2 <u,v>t + |v|^2 \geq 0$ since this quadratic is non-negative we have $D \leq 0$ from here we get the cauchy swarchz inequality.

## For Real Vectors
We have
$$
|u \cdot v| \leq |u| |v|
$$
with equality when u,v are parallel ie 
$$
u = cv, \exists c
$$
thus we may write equality when u,v are proportional.
