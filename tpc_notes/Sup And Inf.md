In a set X which has the [[Axiom Of Completeness]] Property we define supU to be lub of U and InfU to be glb of U.

## Epsilon Criterion
Turns out that $s=\sup A$ iff s is an ub and
$$
\forall \varepsilon>0 : s-\varepsilon \ not \ ub
$$
#mpro #ipro #pro 
-> Obvious
<- ub is given, say there exists an ub l so that $l < s$ then $s-l>0$ which implies $s-(s-l)=l$ is not an ub, a contradiction.
