A [[group]] [[isomorphism]] is a bijective map such that
$$
\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)
$$
This basically means that we can do operations in one space and translate to other.

### Properties
It also preverses commutativity when it exists ie
If G and H are isomorphic and G abelian then H is also abelian. #pro #ipro 
let u,v in H then write u=f(a),v=f(b) then
$$
uv =f(a)f(b)=f(ab)=f(ba)=f(b)f(a)=vu
$$
