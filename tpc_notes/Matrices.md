Just another way to write a linear transform.

## Invertible Matrices
When they don't collapse space into a lower dimension and don't expand into a new one i.e. $\det \ne 0$ they have inverses.

## Augmented Way Of Finding inverse

We take A and I we multiply enough [[elementary matrices]] so that A becomes I and so

$$
E_{1}\dots E_{n}A =I \to  A^{-1} = E_{1}\dots E_{n}I
$$
Thus what I becomes is the inverse.
