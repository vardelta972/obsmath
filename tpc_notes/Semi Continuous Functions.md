f is upper semicontinuous at c iff for any $y>f(c)$ there exists a neighbourhood $V(c)$ such that on that neigbourhood we have $f(x)<y$.

Similarly
f is lower semicontinuous at c iff for any $y<f(c)$ there is a neighbourhood $V(c)$ such that on that neighbourhood we have $f(x)>y.$

## In terms of [[LimeSoup]]

For Upper semicontinuity
$$
\lim \sup_{x \to c} f(x) \leq f(c).
$$
For Lower semicontinuity
$$
\lim \inf_{x \to c} \geq f(c).
$$

### Examples:
$[x]$ is everywhere upper semicontinuous, but not lower semicontinuous.
$\lceil x \rceil$ is everywhere lower semicontinuous but not upper. #pro
