If $\beta$ is a [[base]] then
$$
\tau_{\beta} = \{ U \subseteq X : \forall x \in U \exists B \in \beta : x \in B \subseteq U \}
$$
is called the generated topology by $\beta$ it is a topology.

Another equivalent definition is
$$
\tau_{\beta} = \left\{   \bigcup C : C \subseteq \beta  \right\} \cup \{ \phi \}
$$
