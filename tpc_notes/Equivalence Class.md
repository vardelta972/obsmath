If = is an equivalence relation on X then we define $[x]$ to be set of all things equivalent to x.

## Quotient Sets
We denote set of all equivalence classes as $X/=$. Turns out it partitions X, as each distinct equivalence classes cannot intersect and their union is X. This fact is used in [[Fundamental Counting Principles#Division Principle]]
