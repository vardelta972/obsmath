$$
rxn = K [A]^a [B]^b
$$
where we have, here a,b are obtained from experiments. We use the actual used values of a,b
$$
aA + bB \to Product
$$
For elementary one step reactions. This K=Rate/velocity Constant/Specofic reaction rate

Constant=unity (correction)

K more then exn faster
K less then rxn slower

So K only temp dependent
